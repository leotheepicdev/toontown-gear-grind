# Contributing to Toontown: Gear Grind
Thanks for contributing to Toontown: Gear Grind.

The following is a set of guidelines for developers to follow.

## Commits
- I don't care what the commit names are, as long as they aren't too obnoxious.
- If what you are committing is unstable, keep it in a branch.
- If you want to add a certain feature to the game, let the staff know ahead of time.
- If a bug is fixed, you do not need to consult with anyone else on that.
